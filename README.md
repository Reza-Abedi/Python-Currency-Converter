This Python script facilitates currency exchange rate calculations and currency conversion. Using the forex-python library, it retrieves real-time exchange rates and converts a specified amount from one currency to another. The script is equipped with a user-friendly command-line interface, making it a handy tool for quick currency-related tasks.

Features:

Real-time Exchange Rate Retrieval
Currency Conversion with User Input
Error Handling for Exception Cases
Command-Line Interface for Easy Interaction

Usage Example:
python exchange_rate_calculator.py USD EUR 100

Note:
Ensure an active internet connection for up-to-date exchange rates.
Feel free to use, modify, or integrate this script into your projects for efficient currency-related operations.


To use the currency exchange rate calculator and converter in a web or application, you can follow these general steps:

Create a Web Interface:

Develop a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface.
Use a framework like Flask (for Python) or any other web framework of your choice to build a server.
Integrate Python Code:

Use the existing Python script as the backend logic for handling currency exchange calculations.
Set up endpoints in your web application to interact with the Python script.
Communicate with Python Script:

Use AJAX or fetch API in JavaScript to send requests from the web page to the Python script.
The Python script processes the requests, retrieves exchange rates, and returns the results.
Display Results:

Update the web page dynamically with the results obtained from the Python script.
Here's a basic example using Flask as the web framework:
Python Flask Server:

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
from exchange_rate_calculator import calculate_exchange

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/calculate_exchange', methods=['POST'])
def calculate_exchange_route():
    try:
        from_currency = request.form['from_currency']
        to_currency = request.form['to_currency']
        amount = float(request.form['amount'])

        result = calculate_exchange(from_currency, to_currency, amount)
        return jsonify({'success': True, 'result': result})

    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': str(e)})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

HTML Template (index.html):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Currency Exchange Calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Currency Exchange Calculator</h1>
    <form id="exchangeForm">
        <label for="fromCurrency">From Currency:</label>
        <input type="text" id="fromCurrency" name="from_currency" required>

        <label for="toCurrency">To Currency:</label>
        <input type="text" id="toCurrency" name="to_currency" required>

        <label for="amount">Amount:</label>
        <input type="number" id="amount" name="amount" required>

        <button type="button" onclick="calculateExchange()">Calculate Exchange</button>
    </form>

    <div id="result"></div>

    <script>
        function calculateExchange() {
            // Implement AJAX or fetch to send a request to the Flask endpoint
            // Update the result on the page
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

This is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it based on your specific web framework or application structure. Also, consider security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, before deploying any web application.
